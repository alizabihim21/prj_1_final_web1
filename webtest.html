    The History of the Starbucks Logo
    The development of the coffee maker’s logo was tied closely to its long history. Established in 1971 by a
    group
    of friends and coffee aficionados, Gordon Bowker, Jerry Baldwin, and Zev Siegel, Starbucks originally sold
    mainly coffee beans and coffee-making equipment. However, since then, the company has undergone some large
    ownership changes, which have affected both its products and logo. Let’s see how it happened.
